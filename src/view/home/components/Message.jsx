                Your community experiences your school in a different way, so consider what they have to say and where on your website you can share just that, whether you rephrase it or just use it entirely. And though there are certain areas of your website where it make sense to talk about yourself, it shouldn't be all about you. Think of ways you can replace "we" with "you" to have your prospective visitors feel more like a part of your school.
